# Docker Compose Runtime

This Compose stack is a reproducible **local/demo runtime** for LiemResearch:

- React web app through Nginx on `http://localhost:8080`
- Express API on `http://localhost:4000`
- MongoDB and Redis with persistent named volumes
- opt-in BullMQ workers through Compose profiles

It is suitable for a lecturer to inspect the project architecture and run the
application locally. It is not a replacement for managed production hosting.
MongoDB and Redis are intentionally internal-only; this prevents collisions
with a developer's existing local database and keeps them off the host network.

## 1. Configure secrets

From the repository root:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.compose.example .env.compose
```

Set unique `MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`,
`JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.compose`. Do not send or
commit this file. Generate a JWT secret with:

```powershell
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"
```

## 2. Start the app

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env.compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. API health is at `http://localhost:4000/health`
and API documentation is at `http://localhost:4000/api-docs`.

Stop while retaining data:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env.compose down
```

Delete local Mongo/Redis/upload data as well:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env.compose down -v
```

## 3. Workers are explicit

The default command starts only web, API, MongoDB, and Redis. This prevents a
demo from unexpectedly consuming Gemini quota or processing a large queue.

```powershell
# Reports, gaps, embedding, paper analysis, and notifications
docker compose --env-file .env.compose --profile workers up --build

# Million-scale OpenAlex campaign worker; requires OPENALEX_API_KEY.
docker compose --env-file .env.compose --profile ingest up --build

# Optional Mongo Express, bound only to localhost:8081.
docker compose --env-file .env.compose --profile tools up
```

The OpenAlex campaign worker does not begin a campaign on startup. An admin
must plan and explicitly start a campaign through the API/dashboard.

## 4. Important vector-search boundary

The official `mongo:7` image in this Compose file is MongoDB Community. It does
not contain MongoDB Atlas Vector Search (`mongot`), so `$vectorSearch`-based
semantic search, RAG retrieval, and embedding-backed features cannot be fully
demonstrated against this local Mongo container.

For those features, point `MONGODB_URI` at MongoDB Atlas or a self-hosted
MongoDB deployment where the administrator has installed and configured
`mongot`/Vector Search. Do not claim that plain MongoDB Community provides
Atlas Vector Search.

## 5. OpenAlex authentication

Older project syncs used `OPENALEX_MAILTO` (the historical polite-pool
mechanism). OpenAlex now requires an API key for new API access. Add the free
key as `OPENALEX_API_KEY` before starting the million-scale ingest worker.
The legacy corpus remains valid; the key is required for future provider calls,
not to read existing papers from MongoDB.
